# ✅ Hackathon Project Requirements

To keep submissions fair and consistent, all teams must meet the **minimum requirements** below.  
Creativity is highly encouraged — especially in how you apply **gamification** — but every project should at least satisfy these points.

---

## 📦 Submission Package
Each team must submit:
- **Project code** in a `.zip` file **OR** a **hosted URL** link.  
- A short **manual/guide** (README) that explains:  
  - How to set up and run the project locally (if applicable).  
  - How to use and navigate the website.  
  - Where gamification features are located and how they work.  
- Any **assets** used (e.g., badge/reward art, icons).  

---

## 🌐 Website Requirements
- The website must be **dynamic** (not a static page).  
- Must support **multiple users** with account creation/login.  
- All implemented features (frontend + backend) should work reliably.  
- Should include at least **basic gamification features** (teams are free to decide which mechanics to use).  

---

## 🎮 Gamification Requirement
- Teams are free to be creative, but the site must demonstrate **at least one functional gamification element**, such as:  
  - Points/XP  
  - Levels/progress  
  - Badges/achievements  
  - Leaderboards  
  - Streaks  
  - Quests/challenges
  - Courses/Roadmaps with progress tracking

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team Flexibility
- Any frontend/backend stack or framework is allowed.
- AI tools may be used to vibe code.

## 🎯 Evaluation Criteria (Judges)
Projects will be checked for:
1. **Functionality** → Does it work? Is it usable by the chapter today?  
2. **Creativity** → Are the rewards, themes or mechanics unique and engaging?  
3. **Scalability** → Can future teams extend the platform?  
4. **Fun Factor** → Would students actually enjoy using it?
5. **Inclusivity** → Did non-technical team members contribute meaningfully?
6. **Presentation & Demo** → Can the team show their work professionally?

## 🏆 Final Reminder
Be creative, have fun, and make something you’d be proud to show your fellow students!  
Hackathons are about **learning and experimenting** — don’t be afraid to try bold ideas.
