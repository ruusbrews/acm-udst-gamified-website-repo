# 🛠 Participant Coding Tools

Participants can use **any framework or stack** they’re comfortable with. Below are suggested tools and guides to help speed things up — especially AI-powered ones to boost productivity.

---

## 🎨 Frontend & UI / UX AI Tools

- **GitHub Copilot** → Auto-complete and suggest frontend code (React components, CSS, etc.).
- **Cursor** → AI-powered code editor that can suggest UI logic, refactor, and explain code.
- **Webcrumbs (Frontend AI)** → Generate UI components from prompts or screenshots (with Tailwind, etc.).
- **Bolt.new / V0** → Emerging tools for AI-assisted frontend workflows.
- **DeepCode / Snyk (formerly DeepCode AI)** → Static analysis & code quality checks for frontend (JS, CSS) to flag bugs & security issues.
- **Uizard** → Convert sketches or wireframes into UI prototypes / code.

## ⚙️ Backend & Infrastructure AI Tools

- **Qodo (formerly CodiumAI)** → Generate tests, review code, suggest bug fixes.
- **Codeium** → AI code assistant working across frontend & backend (autocomplete, suggestions).
- **Tabnine** → Contextual code completions using LLMs (works in multiple languages). 
- **BuildShip** → Visually build backend/API workflows (connect AI models, databases) and export code. 
- **Performance / Monitoring AI tools**:  
  - **New Relic**, **Datadog**, **Middleware** → Use AI to detect performance issues, anomalies, errors in backend systems. 
- **Backend.AI** → Platform for building, training, and serving AI models (if your backend itself needs ML).

## 🧰 Dev Helper Tools & Utilities

- **VisBug** → In-browser tool to tweak CSS/layout visually on existing pages (for debugging UI) 
- **LangChain** → For projects needing chatbot or retrieval-augmented capabilities, useful for glueing together LLMs + APIs. 
- **“Design to Code” AI** (e.g. from Figma, Google’s Stitch) → Convert design mockups or prompts into frontend code.  
- **Workik** → AI assistant spanning frontend, backend, database, infrastructure tasks.

> ⚠️ **Note**: AI tools can accelerate development—but generated code still needs human review. Always test, validate, and refactor.
