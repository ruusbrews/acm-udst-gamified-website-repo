# Gamification Principles

Gamification works because it taps into **human motivation**.  
Here are two popular frameworks to keep in mind:

---

## 1. Self-Determination Theory (SDT)
People are motivated when three needs are met:
- **Autonomy** → Choice & freedom. (e.g., pick challenges, customize profile)
- **Competence** → Feeling of mastery. (e.g., levels, XP, progress bars)
- **Relatedness** → Social connection. (e.g., team leaderboards, sharing badges)

## 2. Octalysis Framework (Yu-kai Chou)
Eight "Core Drives" of motivation:
1. **Epic Meaning & Purpose** (part of something bigger)
2. **Accomplishment** (progress, badges, achievements)
3. **Empowerment** (creativity, strategy, problem-solving)
4. **Social Influence** (friends, competition, mentorship)
5. **Scarcity** (limited-time rewards, rare badges)
6. **Unpredictability** (mystery rewards, surprise bonuses)
7. **Ownership** (custom avatars, point economy)
8. **Loss Avoidance** (don’t lose streaks, limited-time perks)

✅ **Hackathon Tip:** Don’t use all of these - pick 2–3 core drives and design around them!
